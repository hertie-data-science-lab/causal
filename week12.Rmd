This week we will consider some supposed alternatives to the
counterfactual theory of causation we have been assuming, and see what
the we would do differently under them.

We will also consider 'process tracing' as a qualitative tool for
investigating causal mechanisms, as a precursor to a general
discussion of how we might use additional information in our causal inferences,
whether qualitative or quantitative.
