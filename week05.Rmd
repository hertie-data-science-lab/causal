By popular demand - more machine learning. Diff-in-diff will move to next
week.

<!--

This week we will cast our analytical eye on the traditional study
designs you will meet in applied economics and policy analysis. We
will focus on identifying the assumptions they require to do causal
inference for us, and on extending them to more complicated policy
scenarios than they were initially designed for.

Everybody knows, and some even love 'fixed effects' and lagged
variables as a tool for dealing with confounding that would otherwise
compromise our causal inferences. But is is surprisingly difficult to
see what we have to assume for them to work. When we do, they can seem
rather less innocuous. We'll take a look.

We will also investigate what happens to 'difference in difference'
analyses when units, e.g. countries or states, receive their
'treatment' at different times. This is a very common and important
situation to study, but the standard tools need adjusting for it.
